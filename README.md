# Linear Calendar

Ok, so, this little project lets you generate linear calendar for year that you have choosen.

I've done it for two reasons:
- I wanted to generate linear calendar for myself
- I wanted to have fun with technologies that I haven't been able to really explore yet

That's why currently there are multiple implementations for the same "problems" (and none of them really works that great :D)

Currently, you can find implemenetations in:
- scala
- elm
