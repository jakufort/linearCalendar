# Linear Calendar in elm

## Why?

I wanted to finally dabble in elm, and, after writing "backend" in scala, I realized that I can write this generated in javascript, so that it could be served directly from github for others to use.

## Used libraries
- pdfmake

## Usage

`index.html` expects two javascript files
- `elm.js` - created using command `elm make src/LinearCalendar.elm --output=js/elm.js`
- `pdfExporter.js` - already inside repository
